    NCBI Datasets API

    ### NCBI Datasets is a resource that lets you easily gather data from NCBI. The Datasets version 2 API is still in alpha, and we're updating it often to add new functionality, iron out bugs and enhance usability. For some larger downloads, you may want to download a [dehydrated zip archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/v2/how-tos/genomes/large-download/), and retrieve the individual data files at a later time. 

    The version of the OpenAPI document: v2
